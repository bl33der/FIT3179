        <h1>Smoking in Transition: Australia’s Changing Relationship with Tobacco</h1>
        <p id="mainheading">
            Smoking remains one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, yet Australia stands out for its
            long-term decline in tobacco use. This visual story explores the changing patterns of smoking across the
            country: by state, gender, age, and community, and compares them globally. Through these data-driven
            insights, we uncover where progress has been greatest, which groups remain at risk, and how Australia’s
            tobacco control policies continue to shape healthier futures.

        <h2>National overview</h2>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Smoking share by state (%)</h3>
                <p>
                    The data shows that smoking prevalence is not evenly distributed across Australia. Tasmania and the
                    Northern Territory have notably higher rates, whereas ACT and Victoria sit well below the national
                    mean. These gaps highlight the geographic dimension of smoking inequality — a key factor for policy
                    targeting.

                <p class="annotation">
                    The burden isn’t uniform. High-prevalence states are where prevention funding and awareness
                    campaigns
                    could yield the greatest marginal impact.

                <h3>Smoking trend by gender</h3>
                <p>
                    While men continue to smoke more than women, the gap between genders has gradually narrowed — a sign
                    that anti-smoking efforts are resonating across the population. This convergence suggests social
                    change, improved education, and equal access to cessation support.

                <p>
                    The grouped bar chart compares smoking levels across age groups and survey years. It reveals that
                    younger Australians (particularly those aged 15–24) have experienced the steepest decline in
                    smoking.
                </p>
                <p class="annotation">
                    The data indicates a generational transition: new cohorts are entering adulthood with lower smoking
                    rates than ever before. Meanwhile, older groups (45+) show slower declines, implying entrenched
                    habits.

                <p>
                    This donut chart visualises the share of smokers by country of origin. Australian-born residents
                    represent the largest group, but migrant communities show varied smoking rates, reflecting different
                    cultural and socioeconomic influences.
                </p>
                <p class="annotation">
                    Some overseas-born groups have higher or lower smoking rates depending on their country of origin
                    and
                    access to public health messaging. These variations underscore the importance of culturally specific
                    tobacco control measures

                <h3>Global smoking prevalence (2025)</h3>
                <p>
                    Australia ranks among the lowest in global smoking prevalence, aligning with countries like Canada
                    and Norway. In contrast, many regions in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia maintain significantly
                    higher smoking rates.

                <p class="annotation">
                    Australia’s sustained policy and education efforts place it as a global leader in tobacco control —
                    though continued vigilance is necessary to maintain progress.
